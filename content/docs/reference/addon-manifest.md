Addons are located inside the `addons` folder. Each addon is inside its own folder as well.
In order to tell the addon loader how the addon plans to work, addons use a standard `addon.json` file located at the root of the addon's folder.  

## `name` (string, required)
The name of the addon. Must be `Sentence case`.  
It needs to be relatively short and consistent with other addon's names.  
Use nouns instead of verbs (for example, `Customizable new sprite position` instead of `Change new sprite position`).

## `description` (string, required)
The description of the addons. Must end with a dot.  
   
Use standard grammar for referring to parts of the Scratch website or editor:  

**Pages on the website:**
* project page
* editor
* (user) profile
* studio page
* forums
* (forum) topic
* (forum) post
* (Scratch) 2.0/3.0-styled page *(a page which looks like Scratch 2.0/3.0, is a part of scratchr2/scratch-www)*

**Scratch UI elements:**
* (website) navigation bar *(only use when talking about the website)*
* (editor) menu bar *(only use when talking about the editor)*
* sprite pane *(the list of sprites below the stage)*
* costume editor *(not paint editor)*, list of costumes
* list of sounds, costume/sound list *(for features that work with both costumes and sounds)*
* costume/sound *(not asset)*
* block category
* block category menu
* block palette
* code area *(not workspace - Code tab excluding the block palette)*
* block dropdown *(a dropdown menu opened by clicking a block input)*
* block context menu *(a menu opened by right clicking a block)*
* script *(not stack of blocks)*
* extension
* comment (on the website/in the code area)

**Locations of added UI elements:**
* in *(not on)* the navigation bar
* on *(not in)* the forums
* on *(not in)* the stage
* above the stage (in the editor/on the project page)
* next to the green flag
* next to the Remix button

**Common words:**
* customizable

## `tags` (array, required)
Tags are used for filtering and badges on the Scratch Addons settings page.  

### Required factual tags
Addons must have one of these tags. No less than one, no more than one.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Tag name</th>
    <th>Used by settings page</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>community</code></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>popup</code></td>

</table>

## Optional factual tags
Addon authors can usually determine these tags themselves.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Tag name</th>
    <th>Used by settings page</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>theme</code></td>
    <td>✔️</td>
    <td>Addons that should be listed in the "themes" category. Tags <code>community</code> or <code>editor</code> are still required.</td>

    <td>Addons that mainly affect the Backdrops/Costumes tab of the editor.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>projectPlayer</code></td>
    <td>✔️</td>
    <td>Addons that affect the project player in both the website and editor, or that add UI elements above the stage.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>comments</code></td>
    <td>❌</td>
    <td>Addons that affect comments on the website, inside project pages, profiles and studios.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Optional subjective tags
Addon authors shouldn't add these tags themselves.  
Whether to add any of these tags will be discussed before merging the addon to the repository.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Tag name</th>
    <th>Used by settings page</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>recommended</code></td>
    <td>✔️</td>
    <td>Addons that add highly requested, removed, or obvious missing features.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>beta</code></td>
    <td>✔️</td>
    <td>Addons that haven't been deeply tested, may break in the future or are known to not work properly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>danger</code></td>
    <td>✔️</td>
    <td>Addons that users shouldn't enable without paying close attention.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## `permissions` (array)
You can specify permissions by providing a `permissions` array.  
Possible items: `"notifications"`, `"badge"`, `"clipboardWrite"`.  

## `persistentScripts` (array)
You can add persistent scripts by providing a `persistentScripts` array conformed of JS files (e.g. `["example.js"]`).

## `userscripts` and `userstyles` (array)
Declaring userscripts and userstyles is very similar.
Unlike persistent scripts, this is an array of objects, not strings.  
Each object must specify the url to the userscript/userstyle through the `"url"` property, and provide an array of URL matches. If any of these patterns match, the userscript/userstyle is injected.

### `matches` (array)
Matches that allow the userscript/userstyle to run on. Values can be a URL match pattern, or `projects`, `projectEmbeds`, `studios`, `profiles`, `topics`, `newPostScreens`, `editingScreens`, `forums`, `scratchWWWNoProject`.
```json
{
  "userscripts": [
    {
      "url": "userscript.js",
      "matches": ["https://scratch.mit.edu/*"]
    },
    {
      "url": "second_userscript.js",
      "matches": ["https://scratch.mit.edu/", "https://scratch.mit.edu/users/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### `settingMatch` (object)
You can provide a `settingMatch` object that will result in your userscript/userstyle only running if the specified option is set to the specified value.
```json
{
  "userstyles": [
    {
      "url": "signature.css",
      "matches": ["https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/*"],
      "settingMatch": {
        "id": "signature",
        "value": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
### `runAtComplete` (boolean, userscripts only)
Specifies whether the userscript should run after the page has loaded (after the window load event). If unspecified, `true` is assumed.  
If set to `false`, the userscript is only guaranteed to run after the \<head> element of the document has loaded.

## `settings` (object)
Settings allow the addon's users to specify settings in Scratch Addons' settings panel. Inside your persistent scripts and userscripts, you can then access those settings with the `addon.settings` API.  
Specify a `settings` property and provide an array of option objects.

The properties of the object are as follows. All properties are required.
- `"name"`: the user-visible text for the option.   
- `"id"`: an identifier to get the user-specified value from your code.  
- `"type"`: either `"boolean"` (a checkbox), `"positive_integer"` (an input box that only allows 0 and above), `"string"` (up to 100 chars),`"color"` (a browser color input that returns a hex code)  or `"select"` (see `"potential_values"`).  
- `"default"`: the default value for the option. A boolean, string, or number, depending on the specified type.  
- `"potentialValues"`: for `"select"` type only. Array of objects, with properties `"id"`, the value received from `addon.settings.get()`, and `"name"`, the user-visible option text.
- `"allowTransparency"`: for `"color"` type only. Boolean.

```json
{
  "settings": [
    {
      "name": "Send notifications",
      "id": "send_notifications",
      "type": "boolean",
      "default": false
    },
    {
      "name": "Notification close delay in seconds",
      "id": "close_delay",
      "type": "positive_integer",
      "default": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

## `credits` (array)

You can provide a `credits` array of objects. This attribution is shown in the extension settings.  
These objects must have a `"name"` attribute set to a string, and they can have a `"link"` attribute with a URL value.  
Example:  
```json
{
  "credits": [
    {
      "name": "Maximouse",
      "link": "https://github.com/mxmou/customize-scratch#watch-youtube-videos-on-scratch-in-full-screen"
    }
  ]
}
```

## `enabledByDefault` (boolean)
You can provide the `enabledByDefault` property and set it to `true` to specify if the addon should be enabled by default. Its default value is `false`.  
Keep in mind, few addons will be enabled by default. If you want your addon to be enabled by default, please open a discussion issue.

## `info` (array)
An array of additional information (e.g. warnings, notices) about the addon. Each item of the array is an object consisting of `type` (string) -either `warning` or `notice` - `text` (string) - the text to be displayed - and `id` (string) - the id of the information.
Example:
```json
{
  "info": [
    {
      "type": "notice",
      "text": "Example notice.",
      "id": "exmapleID"
    },
    {
      "type": "warning",
      "text": "Example warning.",
      "id": "exmapleID"
    }
  ]
}
```

## `presets` (array)
An array of presets for the addon. Each item in the `presets` array should be an object consisting of `name` (string), `id`(string), `description` (string) and `values` (object). The keys in the `values` object should the addon settings ids, and the values should be the values to set the setting with the id of the key to.

 
Example:	
```json	
{
  "presets": [	
    {	
      "name": "preset 1",	
      "id": "preset1",	
      "desctiption": "the first preset",	
      "values": {	
        "boolean_setting": true,	
        "string_setting": "This is a string setting",	
        "integer_setting": 180	
      }	
    }	
  ]	
}
```

## `libraries` (array)
An array of libraries that the addon uses.

## `popup` (object)
When added, creates a new popup tab in the browser popup.
Example:
```json
{
  "popup": {
    "icon": "../../images/icons/envelope.svg",
    "name": "Messaging",
    "fullscreen": true
  }
}
```

## `dynamicDisable` (boolean)
Indicates whether the addon's scripts should be considered disabled when disabled as the page is running. Defaults to `false`.

## `dynamicEnable` (boolean)
Indicates whether the addon's scripts should be considered enabled when enabled as the page is running. Defaults to `false`.

## `injectAsStyleElt` (boolean)
Indicates whether the addon's userstyles should be injected as style elements rather than link elements. Defaults to `false`.

## `updateUserstylesOnSettingsChange` (boolean)
Indicates whether the addon's userstyles should be removed and rematched to the new settings. Defaults to `false`.

## `versionAdded` (string)
The version the addon was added. If the value is the same as the current version of the extension, the addon will get the new tag.
