## (TITLE TODO)


### Begin addon-defined class names with `sa-`

{{< admonition info >}}
We always use `kebab-case` when defining our own class names.
{{< /admonition >}}

For many reasons, including potential class name collisions with Scratch or other extension, it's recommended to begin class names with `sa-`.

<!-- TODO: more details? What about collisisons between different addons? -->

### Avoid `!important` unless absolutely necessary

<!-- TODO: explain and link to resources about specificity -->
<!-- TODO: explain the cases where it's okay to use !important -->

### Using `z-index`

<!-- TODO: explain usage of z-index in the Scratch editor and related concepts -->
