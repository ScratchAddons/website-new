Do you dislike Scratch's new purple colour used throughout the website and editor? If so, Scratch Addons makes it easy to switch back to blue previously used, or use any other color!

1. Open the settings page, search for dark mode and enable the "Editor dark mode and customizable colors" addon.
2. Select the "Scratch's default colours (blue)" preset near the bottom of the addon's card.
3. Do the same with the "Website dark mode and customizable colors" addon.
4. To make the older pages such as profiles or the discussion forums more consistent with the newer ones, enable the "Scratch 2.0 â†’ 3.0 addon".

Now you make projects and browse Scratch with the colours you're used to.

We may also add an addon that removes the new icons from the editor menu bar for those who don't like them in the future.
